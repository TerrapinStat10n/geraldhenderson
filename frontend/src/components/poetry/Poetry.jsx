                                        The echo rumbling through his chest is but a precursor to the falling Rain,<br />

                                        The clouds clear to frame a window open to the heavens, giving way to a Breeze of summer’s sweet relief.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The puddles, a souvenir left behind by the flashing lights and distant Moans of cannon’s fired 
                                        in the sky
                                        bring into view his own reflection, Which wades and waits among constellations for him to understand the
                                        mystery that churns within his heart.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The boy that hid from lightning and hit the light to rid the dark<br />
                                        Soon starts to grasp at curiosities, then cast them into art<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Education is derived from educates<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Derived from that we find a meaning more enlightening than teach<br />
                                        <br />
                                        For, educere’s truthful meaning is to draw out<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He drew out the awe from deep within<br />
                                        Then drew on paper with a pen,<br />
                                        Then drew conclusions from the things he taught himself<br />
                                        <br />
                                        When the papers, filled with expression, had drained all of the ink within his pen<br />
                                        He started seeing things he’d never seen before<br />
                                        <br />
                                        And so, with his senses growing keener he closed his eyes But not his ears <br />
                                        And heard the music playing out from in his mind<br />
                                        The more he listened the more he learned<br />
                                        The more he learned he then portrayed<br />
                                        The sounds were but a seed, with no idea what blossoms grew inside.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        With every strum of rusted steel, plucked by chewed up fingernails<br />
                                        His hands then pushed him headlong into a pool of sound<br />
                                        And the ripple started growing in the storm<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He had sung of war,<br />
                                        of peace,<br />
                                        of love,<br />
                                        of hate,<br />
                                        of pain,<br />
                                        of truth,<br />
                                        and lied<br />
                                        Upon the waves of sound that carried him from his youth.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So as the island of his psyche drifted further out of sight<br />
                                        He saw seas broad with happenstance and consequence’s might<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Like waking up, he wiped the fatigue from his eyes, for he had lost his way<br />
                                        Once floating upon the paradise of sound he found himself drowning in the stagnancy of indecision.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Like the S.O.S. of a stranded ship,<br />
                                        <br />
                                        atop a mountain,<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <div className="long-tab">in the desert;</div>
                                        <br />
                                        the powerful swell of regret bursts out of his mouth<br />
                                        <br />
                                        How did he get here?<br />
                                        Where did he go wrong?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        When did this quest of self-exploration and discovery transform into Such an obscure conquest to hush the hum faintly growing in his being?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Welling up under his tired eyelids his tears stung like ink in a gaping flaw<br />
                                        Washing the dust from his third eye and blotting abstract portrayals of past decisions<br />
                                        Pitch black rivers flowed down his pale cheeks dripping upon his Notebook.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        As his cries of desperation bellow, like thunder;<br />
                                        He grips the lines on his paper so as not to sink in the shallow pool him has found himself in.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Like the dark clouds swirling overhead<br />
                                        His fingerprint spirals outward<br />
                                        Winding like a screaming tornado through the clutter of his conscience.<br />
                                        As he looked overboard, he bared witness to the pitch black rain<br />
                                        Falling from pitch black clouds, into a pitch black reflection pool<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Displaying only the distorted face of a trembling child,<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Barely visible through the impact of the weeping sky<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Dawn is calling him home...<br />
                                        <br />
                                        A distant whisper beckoning the light...<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Like fleeting bedtime stories dancing in the minds of waking men<br />

                                        I read myself a story<br/>
                                        I felt I'd heard a thousand times<br/>
                                        The words were so familiar<br/>
                                        The moral buried in my mind<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        The dust upon its cover<br/>
                                        Had collected over years<br/>
                                        I could not discern the title<br/>
                                        But the authors name read clear<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        It echoed through the chamber<br/>
                                        In which the book was tucked away<br/>
                                        Until, as Destiny would have it<br/>
                                        I came across the place one day<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        "To whomever this is read by,"<br/>
                                        Read the forward, I recall<br/>
                                        "You must read it to completion<br/>
                                        "And you must reckon with it all"<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        The binding was so brittle<br/>
                                        And so weathered in its age<br/>
                                        I tried to gently take such care<br/>
                                        With every turning of the page<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        It had been written in the past<br/>
                                        But it was written in my time<br/>
                                        It wasn't written by a learned man<br/>
                                        Because handwriting was mine<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        Contained within the pages<br/>
                                        Was a story I had heard<br/>
                                        But it was long ago you understand<br/>
                                        And my memory was blurred<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        But between the time I wrote it<br/>
                                        And the time I read the scrawl<br/>
                                        I had only drawn on pleasantries<br/>
                                        And had not faced it all<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        And so came my awakening<br/>
                                        As the book drew to an end<br/>
                                        That within me was a child<br/>
                                        One that I could not defend<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        And in that understanding,<br/>
                                        In that moment of relief,<br/>
                                        I embraced the pain I buried<br/>
                                        So I may overcome my grief <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        My heart was beating softly<br/>
                                        As I closed the dying book<br/>
                                        I then left it in the chamber<br/>
                                        But yet it's words, with me, I took<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        I reread them in my sadness<br/>
                                        And reread them in my joy<br/>
                                        And I reread them almost every day<br/>
                                        Not just for me, but for the boy.<br/>

                                        Touch the very chords that bear my being<br />

                                        Pluck along the fibers of not my soul, nor of my body, but of the source<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Untie the knots within the mind not withstanding the very balance that was strung in all their binding<br />
                                        <br />
                                        For I am music left unsung, tightly woven into canvas left unpainted<br />
                                        <br />
                                        And I seek to be moved<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Unsheathe this mortal mask that bears my name<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Lay it gently on the sounds that boom and quiver from behind it<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Let it see the very nature of it's clad core torn asunder<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Let this persona come to realize the power it conceals<br />
                                        <br />
                                        For what is power hidden, but dishonest?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        And what is behind a mask but simply truth?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I am a cascading torrent of whispered wishes<br />
                                        Strung in harmonious display for all to see, but I<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So move me deeply<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So that I may witness what it is I came to see<br />
                                        For countless lives and loves of generations are brought upon me<br />
                                        <br />
                                        And for what? <br />
                                        <br />
                                        To not be moved?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I am here!<br />

                                        Even as the words escape the mind and penetrate the medium, between these shared veils, we; these words I send to you I pray shall find me<br />

                                        A minute hum beyond the horizon of our minds, beneath the mantle of our hearts<br />

                                        Like a pulse paused pointedly upon the peak of beating, droning without time and forever<br />

                                        Filling the cavernous voids and ventricles between all thoughts and that shared space from which we think them<br />
                                        <br />
                                        A hand, reaching forward, lonely,  to tap upon its own shoulder<br />

                                        The moment when surprise meets relief, when the eternal sleep meets a waking life's first breath<br />

                                        And as easy as it comes, can it go<br />

                                        Love is easy to find, when you stop searching.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        "If you seek love, then you have fooled yourself into believing that you are without it."<br />
                                        <br />
                                        It's the difference between  just walking in the rain, or despising your circumstances that you're walking in the rain. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        There is nothing you can do to stop it, so to curse the heavens for their rain only works to remove peace from your journey.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Peace within, happiness, and love are not goals, they are forms of surrender to our journey. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        But this is learned and forgotten by so many of us, myself included, along the path we all walk.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Think of it like loving a dear friend, even though they are flawed. Orloving  a family member that is unkind. Love is a natural state.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        We seek love from another, for so long and for all the right reasons; validation, respect, affection, attention, empowerment, self worth. And we can and will find that, for a time. <br />
                                        People, however, change.  Trusts and hearts break and what we define as the love we deserve becomes a more evolved, unique, and abstract sort of thing, more reminiscent of an expectation than a sensation. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        A defined and unique love language is one we must speak fluently, if we are to appreciate the love we deserve. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Part of that is holding ourselves to account, demanding from ourselves those aforementioned reasons for the love that we seek in others. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Allowing ourselves time to try, to fumble, and to appreciate the time it takes to harness our own expectations of love placed first upon ourselves, until we are confident we have met them for ourselves.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        And when, through persistent and patient  self-reflection and honest self evaluation, we achieve those expectations we will no longer be in a state of craving such a thing because we embody it. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        That is when we transform from one foolishly willing participant in the naivety of seeking love, into one that simply recognizes (in kind) the ones whose search has, too, ended. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Love is easy to find, when we stop searching for it.<br />

                                        There are things in life that we just can't be let go of easily.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Things we tightly grip as if they were sacred. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Things we just HAVE to hold on to, despite our own intuition and past experiences.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Things we feel the need to clench to ensure that they are there, that it's something real.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Things we squeeze so tight between our hands, it's as if we almost had no control over it to begin with.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So we, white knuckled fools, seek to mold it, shape it, to fit our idea of what it ought to be. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        But we were simply once wanting, unbeknownst, in some quiet place in the mind, or the heart, or the body...that place in which some unfamiliar muffled longing sought fulfilment. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        And just as bodies jolt and jump sometimes in deep rest, we reach out in instinct toward something, anything, and we call it what it isn't. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        And we hold it, for far too long, as some bouquet of misnomered and disheveled stems and petals. <br />
                                        <br />
                                        In our ignorance, our bliss, or our refusal to accept the truth of it, we come to mistake the notion of both things, and soon are left with neither.<br />
